Neuro Sky wrapper for openFrameworks.
=====================================
<a href="http://developer.neurosky.com/">ThinkGear Connector</a> version 2.0.0 and <a href="https://github.com/jefftimesten/ofxJSON">ofxJSON</a> is needed.

I did this fork because I needed callbacks for the headset signals, so that i.e I can make a onEEG() event that gets triggered whenever new brainwaves are received.
